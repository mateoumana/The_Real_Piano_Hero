# The_Real_Piano_Hero
This is a real version of Piano Hero, by means of resonator filters for the detection the notes of the fifth scale of the piano. The graphical interface was made in an arduino mega, and an application developed in qt creator was also included, which decides the start of the game and is connected to a database to which each participant who plays is registered.
The version one was created to play without the database, while version two is created to be able to communicate with the database.
